Files Go by Google

The Files Go application is a file management application developed by Google on December 5, 2017 [1]. Files Go also has a feature to transfer files between smartphones that have the application installed on them. The application mainly helps in clearing junk files to free up space on the device using machine learning and provides an effective way to manage different files under a folder structure [2]. It detects duplicate and large files (such as videos) present on the phone and notifies the user whether these files can be deleted or not. It can also detect applications that remain unused for a long time and notifies the user regarding the same.

The transferring of files by Files Go is similar to Lenovo’s SHAREit application. For a file transfer to take place between two phones, an internet connection is not required: Files Go sets up a personal hotspot to establish communication among the devices.
 
 The reason for choosing Files Go was because of its cleanup and sharing features. It has received a 4.6 rating on the Playstore with hundreds of positive reviews. It has a simple user interface to navigate. It does not host annoying ads (unlike SHAREit).

 The application does have the potential to become popular amongst the smartphone users’ community because many users have issues with files or applications that take up a large amount of storage space on their devices. For example, WhatsApp users tend to receive hundreds of forwards (such as images, video clips, etc.) a month from different users and not many have the time to delete every image or video they receive on a WhatsApp group every single time. Additionally, Files Go provides its users to share files seamlessly without the internet.
 
Files Go uses Google’s mobile vision technology which detects and highlights duplicate videos and images by detecting visual objects in them [3].

 File transfers in Files Go is done using the Wi-Fi-Direct technology which is faster than Bluetooth. Hence large files can be shared quickly.
 
The application has many strengths when compared to its weaknesses: It has a simple UI, works as a great cleaner application, lightweight application, rapid transfer of files. The only weakness is that file sharing can be done within a limited distance because of the Wi-Fi-Direct feature.

Although the application seems to be perfect, there is some room for improvement: The user must have the option to set a notification when the space occupied by the junk files exceed a limit. For example, the user may want to clear the clutter only when the space occupied by the junk files exceed 1GB. As of now, Files Go keeps reminding its users to clean their phone almost every single day.

 GOOGLE LENS  

Google Lens is a smart image recognition application by Google. It was initially released on October 4, 2017. The Google Lens application has been designed to recognize different objects in the surroundings and look it up on the web. It can also remember the Wi-Fi network and password when the SSID sticker behind the router is scanned [1]. Google Lens has Google Assistant embedded in it, which means voice input can be used to search through Google Lens.

Google Lens has the following features: It can detect phone numbers, dates and addresses; search for clothing and furniture; identify plants and animal breeds; discover books, music albums, movies and video games. These features are based on Image Processing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing when detecting objects in real life.
 
 This application was chosen because of its amazing ability to apply Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to detect everyday objects. Google Lens can be really helpful in detecting objects that may look unfamiliar to us. For example, Google Lens can provide users with suggestions when a picture of a random object, such as a lamp, is taken.
 
The Google Lens application has received a rating of 2.8 on the Playstore for an older version. Although Google Lens can efficiently recognise different objects, it still has trouble in detecting highlighted text. Probably, the application might develop and serve more users in the future.
